MEMO 2

I have completely reorganized all of the files so its a bit easier to look at. The account folder
holds all account level files, and the list folder holds the list level files.

MEMO 1

For all pages with a header, all non-header content must be contained in a 'div class="container"'
The container class has a margin-top that pushes content down so it shows below the fixed header.

ATTENTION PLEASE READ

Please keep the CSS sheet organized so that when stuff starts going wrong we don't 
wanna kill ourselves finding that one tiny error in a thousand lines of code. Use comments
to keep different tags in different sections, and if you're changing an existing element
add your CSS in the section for that element (like the forms that we've done)
