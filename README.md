ATTENTION PLEASE READ

Please keep the CSS sheet organized so that when stuff starts going wrong we don't 
wanna kill ourselves finding that one tiny error in a thousand lines of code. Use comments
to keep different tags in different sections, and if you're changing an existing element
add your CSS in the section for that element (like the forms that we've done)
